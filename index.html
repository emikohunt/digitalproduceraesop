				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<p>I have been working in marketing and communications for over five years.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I started out in book publishing and editing, but my passion forged ahead with developing technologies and I've gained skills and developed a keen interest in the digital sphere.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I have a knack for social media, blogs, content creation, digital production, website and CRM management as well as copywriting and editing. I'm also a great project manager – from digital projects to events or website redesigns.</p>
				</br>
				<p>I get a serious satisfaction from ticking off a to-do list, I love anything digital and I love learning – I'm currently taking a night course in front-end web development, which is how I made this website for you!</p>
				<br>
				<p>Outside of work, I love to read, cook (and eat) Japanese food, exercise, go to gigs and exhibitions and I'm a keen traveller. I enjoy the outdoors, sunshine, learning new things and I am a huge animal lover – show me a dog wearing a bandana I'm all smiles.</p>

				<h2>KEY SELECTION CRITERIA</h2>
				<a name="ksc"></a>
				<br>
				<h4>Why is Aesop a brand for which you would be proud to work?</h4>
				<br>
				<h4>How do your interests align with Aesop?</h4>
				<br>
				<h4>When has your energy and enthusiasm paid off professionally?</h4>
				<br>
				<p>Aesop is a brand of integrity. Managing to flourish in an unreliable retail environment is testament to the quality of product, brand and vision. I admire that about your organisation; that strength of character and integrity in what you do.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For me to work for a company, I need to believe in what they do and be proud to put my name to the work I provide. Aesop is one of those rare finds, especially in the “beauty” industry. I admire that Aesop’s perception of beauty encompasses intelligence, art, knowledge, and research. I regard your lack of false promises, your stance on quality, your ability to arouse and your ability to captivate in a most understated way.</p>
				<br>
				<p>You embrace that what we put into our skin and therefore bodies becomes who we are in a molecular level. The fact that Aesop predominantly use plant-based ingredients and invest vast time into product research and development with rigorous testing (that is not done on animals) resonates with my beliefs.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I adore that your founder makes statements with soul:</p>
				<br>
				<p>"I was horrified at the thought of Aesop evolving into a soulless chain," he says. "I’ve always imagined what we do as the equivalent of a weighty, gold charm bracelet on the tanned wrist of a glamorous, well-read European woman who has travelled and collected interesting experiences. I felt and still do that it should be possible to grow in a lateral way without prostituting the essence of what the company is about." Dennis Paphitis, interview with http://www.dezeen.com/2012/12/10/dennis-paphitis-aesop-interview/</p>
				<br>
				<p>As someone who enjoys the arts, Aesop’s embracement of art is appealing. Visiting an Aesop store is a sensory experience, rather than an exchange of money for product. I love that you offer a “bi-monthly literary gesture” through The Fabulist (one of my first jobs was working for a literary journal). I enjoy your commitment to producing media and communication that is underpinned by the creation of beauty rather than a marketing message. Your brand works because it is at the very essence who you are and it is unique and it is charming.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I think that concludes my ode to Aesop, or rather the answer to your first two questions.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Here is my response to the third:</p>
				<br>
				<h4>When has your energy and enthusiasm paid of professionally?<h4></h4>
				<br>
				<p>In April I will attend a graduation ceremony. This ceremony represents a celebration of the hard work and energy that students at the college I work for have put in. This group of graduating students are the first group who I have worked from their start to their conclusion at the college. I’ve seens them as nervous first-day students, then watched them develop skills and knowledge that would both frustrate and excite them, to now having Bachelor Degrees and working in an industry they dreamed of.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Education is strength and an opportunity that provides much more than an academic piece of paper. These students have grown and I’ve been able to watch them, just as they’ve watched my career, skills and knowledge grow. The way the college looked, felt, positioned itself when these students began over two years ago is different. We have grown, firmed our stance, strengthened our team, adapted to changes, learnt, become more creative, developed more partnerships, become more respected, have produced amazing outputs, held beautiful music events.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I’m proud of these students. I am also proud that my work played a part in assisting them to realise their dreams to end up in careers that they love. I’m also proud that the time, energy, work and passion I have put into this organisation has seen it move to great successes with a community of students, teachers and staff who are at heart a wonderful group of people who work together with respect and gratitude. </p>
